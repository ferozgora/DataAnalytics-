## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#datatype.R
#numerical
#this is a dbl_var
a<-c(4.3,2.5,2,3.2,2.5,3.4)
#adding an L specifies intigers
b<-c(4L,2L,1L,10L,32L,11L)
# you can change types
num<-as.numeric(b)
#typeof function gives back the type
typea<-typeof(a)
typeb<-typeof(b)
#you can round numbers up or down based on commands
roundup<-ceiling(a)
rounddown<-floor(a)
# I can also compare vectors
c<-c(1,2,3,4,5)
d<-c(1,6,7,8,5)
#is c the same as d, you need the same number of numbers
c==d
# you can do this with < less than, > greater than, <= less than or equal, >= greater of equal
c>=d
# i can also check if the sets are identical
identical(c,d)
#you can have seqences and have them go up by intervals
seq<-seq(from=20, to=50, by=5)
#you can also make sequeces that have a specified length using length out
seq1<-seq(from=2, to=100, length.out=5)
#, you don't to from and t
seq2<-seq(2,100, length.out=5)
#there are also repeated sequences: each and times. They place the numbers differently though
#if you want #s next to eachother use each
seq3<-rep(1:6, each = 3)
#vs times
seq3<-rep(1:6, times = 3)
#runif is a random number generator
randnum<-runif(10)
hist(randnum)
# to create a more unifromed graph increase the number
randnum1<-runif(100000)
hist(randnum1)
#when generating random numbers not everyone gets the same results like they do in sequences
# you can also specify parameters incase you want to take a SRS with a definite number 
randnum2<-runif(100, min = 0, max = 10000)
#in Statistics there can be sampling with or without replacement
#without, you get unique numbers
sample(0:100, 12, replace = FALSE)
#with: you can get repeating numbers
sample(0:100, 12, replace = FALSE)
#normal curves are used and is a condition for many test, it has a stn.dev of 1 and a mean at the center of 0
#using this I generalted random z scores
rnorm(12, mean = 0, sd = 1)
#setting the seed will give you the same results every time
set.seed(1100)
rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)



#character
#in vectors if characters are combined with numerical value each elements is treated as a string
string<-c("j","k","l",0,9,8)
string1<-c("p","q","r",6,9,8)
#now there are quotes around the numbers too 
# you can also combine string and you can seperate them using the sep function
paste(string,string1, sep="A")
#you can ask if the string is a character type using #is.character and you can change it using as.character
v<-c(4,3,4,4,5)
as.character(v)
# now they all have quotes
# i can again get rid of the quotes
print(v, quotes=false)
#I can find the length by using the function length
# If everything is under 1 quote it is considered as there is only one element 
length(string1)

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
